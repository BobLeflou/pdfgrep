# Contributing

You don't have to write code to help pdfgrep. Testing, reporting bugs,
writing/fixing documentation or packaging it for distributions is just
as important. If you want to help, just drop me[1] a mail.

For those who rather get their hands dirty with code, please read the
following sections:

# Coding Style

The pdfgrep source is formatted in the classical Linux-kernel style
described in Documentation/CodingStyle in the kernel's source tree.

In particular this means that we use tabs for indentation.

The code is written in a C-ish C++, which means we use classes
sparingly and everything is mostly held in a procedural style.

But: These are just guidelines. If a C++ feature makes sense to you,
use it! If a (minor) violation of the indentation rules makes the code
more readable: do it!

# Sending Patches

You can either send your patches directly to me[1], to the mailing-list[2] or
create a pull request on GitLab[3].


Keep on hacking!
