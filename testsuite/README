This directory contains the testsuite for pdfgrep.

## Dependencies

The tests depend on the following packages:

  - dejagnu
  - pdflatex

## Running

To run the tests, execute `make check` from the toplevel source
directory.

To get test coverage, first run `make clean` and then

    make check CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11 --coverage"

You can then use gvov and lcov to view the results. See the internet
for more information on how to use those.

## Writing new tests
