set test "Match line after double match"

# pdfgrep currently prints a line with two matches twice. This is of course not
# grep compatible and should be changed in the future.

# Nevertheless, right now it's the documented behaviour and should be tested
# for.

# This case tests specifically for a bug where a line after a double match would
# not be printed.
