This directory contains the testsuite for pdfgrep.

WARNING: Many of these test cases only pass with a patch for a bug in
poppler-cpp. See https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91644

The tests depend on the following packages:

  - dejagnu
  - pdflatex


To run the tests, execute `make check` from the toplevel source
directory.

To get test coverage, first run `make clean` and then

    make check CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11 --coverage"

You can then use gvov and lcov to view the results. See the internet
for more information on how to use those.
