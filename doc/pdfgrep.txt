NAME
----
pdfgrep - search pdf files for a regular expression

SYNOPSIS
--------
*pdfgrep* ['OPTION'...] 'PATTERN' 'FILE'...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Search for 'PATTERN' in each 'FILE'. 'PATTERN' is an extended regular
expression.

*pdfgrep* works much like grep, with one distinction: It operates on
pages and not on lines.

OPTIONS
-------
*-i*, *--ignore-case* :: Ignore case distinctions in both the
  'PATTERN' and the input files.

*-F*, *--fixed-strings* :: Interpret 'PATTERN' as a list of fixed
  strings separated by newlines, any of which is to be matched.

*-P*, *--perl-regexp* :: Interpret 'PATTERN' as a Perl compatible
  regular expression (PCRE). See 'pcresyntax'(3) for a quick overview.

*-H*, *--with-filename* :: Print the file name for each match. This is
  the default setting when there is more than one file to search.

*-h*, *--no-filename* :: Suppress the prefixing of file name on
  output. This is the default setting when there is only one file to
  search.

*-n*, *--page-number* :: Prefix each match with the number of the page
  where it was found.

*-c*, *--count* :: Suppress normal output. Instead print the number of
  matches for each input file. Note that unlike grep, multiple matches
  on the same page will be counted individually.

*-p*, *--page-count* :: Like *-c*, but prints the number of matches
  per page.

*-C*, *--context* 'NUM' :: Print at most 'INUM' characters of context
  around each match. The exact number will vary, because pdfgrep tries
  to respect word boundaries. If 'NUM' is "*line*", the whole line
  will be printed. If this option is not set, pdfgrep tries to print
  lines that are not longer than the terminal width.

*--color* 'WHEN' :: Surround file names, page numbers and matched text
  with escape sequences to display them in color on the terminal. (The
  default setting is *auto*). 'WHEN' can be:
  *always* ;; Always use colors, even when stdout is not a terminal.
  *never* ;; Do not use colors.
  *auto* ;; Use colors only when stdout is a terminal.

*-r*, *--recursive*:: Recursively search all files (restricted by
  *--include* and *--exclude*) under each directory, following symlinks
  only if they are on the command line.

*-R*, *--dereference-recursive*:: Same as *-r*, but follows all
  symlinks.

*--exclude=*'GLOB' :: Skip files whose base name matches 'GLOB'. See
  'glob'(7) for wildcards you can use. You can use this option
  multiple times to exclude more patterns. It takes precedence over
  *--include*. Note, that in- and excludes apply only to files found
  via *--recursive* and not to the argument list.

*--include=*'GLOB' :: Only search files whose base name matches
  'GLOB'. See *--exclude* for details. The default is '*.pdf'.

*--password=*'PASSWORD' :: Use PASSWORD to decrypt the PDF-files.
  *Note* that this password will show up in your command history and
  the output of 'ps'(1). So please do not use this if the security of
  'PASSWORD' is important. It is also currently not possible to use
  individual passwords for different files.

*-m*, *--max-count* 'NUM' :: Stop reading a file after 'NUM' matching
  lines. When the -c or --count option is also used, pdfgrep does not output a
  count greater than 'NUM'.

*--debug* :: Enable debug output. *Note*: Due to limitations of
   poppler before version 0.30.0, some debug output is also printed
   without *--debug* when using such a poppler version.

*--unac* :: Remove accents and ligatures from both the search pattern
  and the PDF documents. This is useful if you want to search for a
  word containing "ae", but the PDF uses the single character "Ã¦"
  instead. See *unac(3)* and *unaccent(1)* for details.
+
*This option is experimental and only available if pdfgrep is
compiled with unac support.*

*-q*, *--quiet* :: Suppress all normal output to stdout. Errors will
  be printed and the exit codes will be returned (see below).

*--help* :: Print a short summary of the options.

*-V*, *--version* Show version information.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
The behavior of *pdfgrep* is affected by the following environment
variable.

*GREP_COLORS* :: Specifies the colors and other attributes used to
  highlight various parts of the output. The syntax and values are
  like *GREP_COLORS* of *grep*. See 'grep'(1) for more details.
  Currently only the capabilities *mt*, *ms*, *mc*, *fn*, *ln* and
  *se* are used by *pdfgrep*, where *mt*, *ms* and *mc* have the same
  effect on *pdfgrep*.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
Normally, the exit status is 0 if at least one match is found, 1 if no
match is found and 2 if an error occurred. But if the *--quiet* or
*-q* option is used and a match was found, *pdfgrep* will return 0
regardless of errors.
