.TH pdfgrep 1 "April 16, 2010" "version 0.1" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
pdfgrep \- search pdf files for a regular expression
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdfgrep
.RI [ OPTION .\|.\|.]
.I PATTERN
.IR FILE .\|.\|.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Search for \fIPATTERN\fP in each \fIFILE\fP. \fIPATTERN\fP is an
extended regular expression.
.PP
.B pdfgrep
works much like grep, with one distinction: It operates on pages and
not on lines.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\^\-ignore-case
Ignore case distinctions in both the \fIPATTERN\fP and the input
files.
.TP
.BR \-H ", " \-\^\-with-filename
Print the file name for each match. This is the default setting when there is
more than one file to search.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\^\-no-filename
Suppress the prefixing of file name on output. This is the default setting
when there is only one file to search.
.TP
.BR \-n ", " \-\^\-page-number
Prefix each match with the number of the page where it was found.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\^\-count
Suppress normal output. Instead print the number of matches for each
input file. Note that unlike grep, multiple matches on the same page
will be counted individually.
.TP
.BR \-C ", " \-\^\-context " " \fINUM\fP
Print at most \fINUM\fP characters of context around each match. The
exact number will vary, because pdfgrep tries to respect word
boundaries. If this option is not set, pdfgrep prints the whole line
of the match.
.TP
.BR \-\^\-color " " \fIWHEN\fP
Surround file names, page numbers and matched text with escape
sequences to display them in color on the terminal. (The default setting is
\fBauto\fP).
